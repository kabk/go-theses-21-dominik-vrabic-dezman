        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is becoming increasingly integrated into global society – it is often referred to
          as
          the
          latest general-purpose technology<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Significant advances in machine learning and proliferation of big
          data
          have
          resulted in a social climate sensitised towards AI’s exponential societal integration. Upon closer
          examination,
          an
          observable gap becomes clear between AI’s status quo of rapid social integration, and the hype in its
          mediated
          visuality.</p>
        <p>I argue that this gap – between the actual social implementation and integration of AI, and the sublime,
          religiously exalted, mediated visual image of it – consists of a fundamental misrepresentation and
          non-understanding
          of AI, intensification of technicist power and globalising capital accumulation.</p>
        <p>Secondly, this thesis questions and destabilises AI’s narrowly mediated public visuality. Every figuration
          of
          AI,
          a
          fundamentally non-visual technology, is inherently an artistic gesture – the agency and social
          responsibility
          of
          the
          designer are therefore increasingly crucial in mediating emergent concepts such as AI to the public. The
          focus
          of
          this essay is on the production and perpetuation of signification – image-producers, and platforms involved
          in
          the
          propagation of imagery surrounding AI. The thesis attempts to trace the cultural authority that AI has taken
          on
          through its being-mediated-as-image.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, this thesis proposes some possible future strategies and urgencies of desisting from the current
          problematic of sublime disclosure of emerging technologies, using AI as a central case study.</p>
        <p>The research is positioned at the vanguard of cultural production at the time of writing. A central
          methodology
          is
          the collecting and organising of visual material pertaining the mediated visuality of AI. This includes
          archival
          footage, art reports, art writing, tweets, emoji, screenshots.</p>

        <p>[todo] Thanks, remarks</p>
        <p>It appears we are in the midst of an <em>AI turn</em>, which is reflected in the recent explosion of
          writings,
          critical academic pieces, art projects, researches … During the time of writing, many more initiatives will
          have
          been published. This thesis does not aim to be comprehensive. My hope is for this paper to mark a small
          contribution
          to the exponentially growing mosaic of work produced in recent years.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“In the context of this thinning boundary [between art and technology], it seems legitimate and necessary
            to
            ask
            whether and to what extent … art is complicit with the manipulative flows of power or whether, on the
            contrary,
            it
            exposes, complicates, or perhaps even contests them.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
              role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The thesis emerged from a personal fascination with the phenomenon of artificial intelligence and a big
          involvement
          in technology… It began as an exploration of AI aesthetics, and the seeming lack of consensus of what the
          term
          might
          refer to, and how it has been addressed by several artists and designers. First grounded in arts and design,
          the
          focus soon shifted. I am very interested in AI’s marching prominence into the fabric of our society, which
          has
          happened seemingly overnight, and continues to permeate the fabric of our existence. Eventually, the broader
          interest became clear – to examine the visuality of AI as a hallmark of AI’s ontological status in the
          world,
          vis-à-vis its exponentially intensifying presence in our society.</p>
        <p>The distinction between artist and designer is not important for the aims of this paper. The focus is on
          visuality,
          the aesthetic conceptions and frontages devised to mediate the concept of Artificial Intelligence in the
          public
          sphere. I rather distinguish between <em>images</em>, <em>image-producers</em> and <em>image-platforms</em>.
          It
          is
          my belief that every role of visual production inherently possesses the responsibility and potential to/of
          political
          agency. My conviction is that art and design should be actively engaged in the social and political reality
          of
          our
          world. They should not be disinterested.</p>
        <p>The focus of this paper is on signifiers. Those may hail from art, design, mediasphere, or any interstitial
          space.
          These disciplines, and the artefacts that they produce, are directly plugged in to the global machinery of
          cultural
          production. They are a product of their surrounding cultural regime. I am mapping and exploring what this
          regime
          might be.</p>
        <p>This thesis is a call to action, a soft proposal. It might become the seed of an expansive, omnidirectional
          flow
          of
          possibilities. In that way, it aspires to be non-directional, non-arboreal, non-linear in its ambition of
          proposing
          a way forward. Several such possibilities are explored, and I try to legitimize them in the context of a
          theoretical
          framework. Together, they represent but a miniscule subset of an incomprehensibly bigger set of strategies
          for
          progressing from our present paradigm. I hope that each small possible move forward may be regarded as an
          emancipatory strategy in its own regard.</p>
        <p>This thesis aims to perform the work of a discursive prism through which the narrowly mediated visual flow
          is
          examined, scrutinised, destabilised, diffused, reconfigured, and finally projected omnidirectionally as
          loose
          trajectories of poietic potential, pointing towards diverse alternatives of social relating to AI on its way
          towards
          settling in the new normal of our newly inaugurated, AI-powered, era.</p>

        <p>Images as subjects of study are of a particular note in this social moment. We have undergone the
          <em>pictorial
            turn</em>, <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> in which
          symbolic-representation systems have taken central place. It has never been so interesting to look at images
          and
          decode the substratum of reality that they are supposedly representations of. Media theorist Vilem Flusser,
          too,
          amplifies the importance of this shift. Tracing the thinking of Baudrillard, Flusser posits that "the
          existential
          interests of the material world are being replaced by symbolic universes and the values of things.”<a
            href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>The oversaturation of images in our daily life seems to further confirm these posits since the authors’
          time
          of
          writing. The image has become the universal building block of our culture, which is becoming predominantly
          visual.
          The image affects many more people more greatly than text: "The illiterate are no longer excluded, as they
          used
          to
          be, from a culture encoded in texts, but participate almost totally in a culture encoded in images.”<a
            href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
        <p>The role of the image is no longer to mediate an underlying authentic reality, as has been the case for a
          long
          time. It is to signify a concept.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Images are significant surfaces. Images signify – mainly – something 'out there' in space and time that
            they
            have to make comprehensible to us as abstractions (as reductions of the four dimensions of space and time
            to
            the
            two surface dimensions).”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The status of imagery should be withdrawn from a traditional conception of an opaque, prima facie,
          representational
          artefact. In our present time, images hold a new modality of social existence. The Centre for the Study of
          the
          Networked Image has put forward the term “Networked Image”:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“… the”networked image" is at the centre of a new global mode of reproduction and representation in which
            the
            visual image is paramount. … what constitutes an image has been radically transformed, and with it the
            theories
            that allow us to study it.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
              role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
          </p>

        </blockquote>

          distributed and computational object …. in using the term ‘networked image’ — preferring it to operative or
          computational image, or even post-photography — we emphasise the network as a descriptor of dynamic social
          relations as much as technological infrastructure.”<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"

        <p>Googling the keyword “Artificial Intelligence” summons a slew of diverse images. Scrolling through the
          search
          results, more of the same emerges… It seems as if these images all hail from the same fictive universe of
          blue
          monochrome zeros and ones, materialising from the depths of infinite space before dissolving and
          disappearing
          back
          again... Examining the results further, we encounter robots, humanoid hands, clashes between organic,
          arboreal
          networks and digital, orthogonally delineated circuitry… Repeating the same search on other platforms, such
          as
          Flickr and Yahoo Images, yields more of the same. It seems we are encountering an artistic canon.</p>

        <p>In most cases, the subject (AI) takes on an extremely anthropomorphised form, appearing as a prototypically
          white
          human-like robot,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> or in
          others,
          a
          body part (typically a brain, arm, leg) stylised to appear composed of ethereal circuitry. The suggestion of
          infinite space is further reinforced by an expansive dark vacuum surrounding the subject, or in other cases,
          an
          infinitely distant vanishing point. The colour palette is typically delimited to blue monochrome, a palette
          employed
          perennially in the mediation of cyber technology. The images are rife with pictorial stand-ins for
          intellectual
          potency. The portrayed anthropomorphic figures are often seen instructing, operating machinery, manipulating
          floating touch-screen interfaces.</p>

        <p>The central subject of these visual artefacts is typically seen suspended in the centre of the picture
          plane,
          often
          the sole resident of this elevated domain. It could be described as a depersonalised subject, and at the
          same
          time,
          a sprawling constellation. The entity inhabits a deep blue habitat. Its constitution extends into an
          unfathomably
          extensive network of 0s and 1s, of cables, flows, nodes – all conduits for the dissemination of data, their
          mainspring. It is represented as travelling streams of light, or undulating waves perturbing the surface of
          an
          unfathomably deep ocean<em>.</em> An intense visual velocity is present in the depicted directional streams.

        <p>The images bestow upon the beholder the dominance of this abstract, diffused entity of artificial
          intelligence,
          while assembling a language of visual unity. They invite a certain sublime feeling, offsetting rational
          interpretation to secondary importance.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"

        <p>These visual artefacts as a whole appear to tell a myth about the social role of artificial intelligence.
          Following
          their chain of signification, it appears they point nowhere, to the absence of reality, or a complete
          dismissal
          of
          any tangential, actuality. By means of repetition, and reinforcement, these deep blue visuals reinstate and
          affirm
          the performative role of these emergent technologies in our society… They reinforce the link between
          stand-in
          and
          the concept it represents… and point to no concept whatsoever! These visual flows might well be considered
          simulacra, based on the fundamental absence (dissimulation) of the material referent they’re denoting.
          Rather,
          they
          are chimaeric visual forms of a compounding stack of cultural stereotypes and tired, repetitive iconography.
        </p>
        <p>Branching out and asking Google for images of other emerging cybertechnologies, such as Bitcoin,
          Blockchain,
          The
          Cloud, procures remarkably similar results. The deep-blue imagery saturates the whole media ecosystem – it
          has
          crept
          in to accompany everything from blogs, clickbait articles, radio shows, to reputable news sources.</p>

        <p>It is difficult to identify the intention of such imagery, if there is any there in the first place. They
          clearly
          do not faithfully or accurately represent AI. Turning the optics of analysis, we can begin to inspect the
          source
          of
          these visual flows, where the canon is continually renewed, produced, and advanced. Hiking further and
          analysing
          the
          sources of these search results and media pieces harbouring them, one is typically directed to stock-photo
          platforms. There, the deep blue aesthetic reigns supreme. Together with the media, these are sites of
          fabrication
          of
          the image that lands in collective memory.</p>

        <p>The exponentially growing demand of AI-related imagery is being answered by a proliferation of visual
          production,
          mostly taking place on stock-image search platforms, that appears to be consolidating into a legitimate
          aesthetic
          genre. These flows of visual production are governed by the same received cliches in the visual articulation
          of
          the
          images in question. The ideas are increasingly ensconcing themselves in collective imagination through a
          scattered
          process of trans-cultural diffusion, culminating in the reproduction of identical aesthetic choices and
          imperatives.
          This narrow articulation of the aesthetic norm has been further reinforced by the demand generated by media
          outlets,
          which purchase said images from the image-producers, to use in their own published content. This is, of
          course,
          a
          simplified rendition of the whole complexity of the transactions. It does seem like a very plausible claim,
          however,
          that the exponentially growing mention of AI is collaterally bringing an exponentially growing number of
          images
          used
          to mediate the concept.</p>

        <p>Another prominent trope that appears is the comparison of the brain to the computer. The comparison has
          abided
          in
          academia and common discourse for a long time. The general critical consensus is that far too much intensity
          has
          been placed on constructing a consensus of high similarity between a biological framework and that of
          artificial
          intelligence.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> The
          comparison
          of the human brain to a computer has been criticised as early as in 1951, by neuroscientist Karl Lashley:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Descartes was impressed by the hydraulic figures in the royal gardens and developed a hydraulic theory
            of
            the
            action of the brain,” Lashley wrote. “We have since had telephone theories, electrical field theories and
            now
            theories based on computing machines and automatic rudders. I suggest we are more likely to find out about
            how
            the
            brain works by studying the brain itself, and the phenomena of behaviour, than by indulging in far-fetched
            physical analogies.”<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>

        <p>The reproduction of these aesthetic trends contributes to the formation and concretization of a mythology
          surrounding AI, and its current hype. It has produced a discursive regime within which a limited, extremely
          specific
          palette of visual vocabulary (in many cases clearly traceable to its originator) stands available, borrowed
          from
          a
          narrow part of the vast pool of (popular) cultural production. Admittedly, one may observe multiple
          exceptions
          this
          narrowly-defined normativity – they are, however, very few in number.</p>
        <p>The only way in which most people have experienced or seen AI has been mediated through image search
          platforms,
          sensationalised media broadcasts, popular culture, cinema. These image-producers has subsequently become
          image-makers for the public image of Artificial Intelligence. They solidify our understanding of AI in terms
          of
          these images. Molly Wright Steenson comments on the status of popular imagery used to represent the
          technology:
          "Our
          pop culture visions of A.I. are not helping us. In fact, they're hurting us. They're decades out of date.
          And
          to
          make matters worse, we keep using the old clichés in order to talk about emerging technologies today.”<a
            href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
        <p>Steenson proceeds to quote Eric Johnson:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Today, intelligent environments are a reality. But why do we depict them as layered and ghosted? "These
            cultural
            clichés/touchstones are popular for another reason: It is really, really hard to talk about
            digital-reality
            tech
            otherwise …. These fields are full of jargon, inconsistent in practice and difficult to grok if you
            haven't
            seen
            all the latest demos; pop culture is a shortcut to a common ideal, a shared vision.”<a href="#fn26"
              class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I wonder what better ways exist than the reproduction of these tired clichés.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-ai-anyways">What is AI, Anyways?</h2>
        <p>In discussing AI, one may before long encounter a slippage of reliable, explicitly agreed-upon definitions
          owing
          to
          an overlaying lack of consensus, chaos around the current implementations of AI, and an evident discrepancy
          between
          its media sensationalism and the inchoate status quo of the technology...</p>
        <p>In pursuit of an agreed-upon definition of Artificial Intelligence, I turned to the dictionary, where AI is
          defined
          as: “The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human
          intelligence,
          such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.”<a
            href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> The definition does
          little
          to clarify the
          ambiguity, it seems rather autological. So, I proceeded to the drawing board…</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/media/image19.jpeg"
            alt="Figure 19: Diagram – Taxonomy of AI. Some of the many referents of “AI”…" />

        </figure>
        <p>In fact, there is no singular type of AI. The field refers to an extremely vast conglomerate of diverse
          tangential
          disciplines, that have come to be contained under the same sign. Framing AI as an unorganized cluster of
          loosely
          correlated semantic forms helps in discussing the multiplex nature of its social integration. It is
          important
          to
          question the catch-all that has become draped around and above the disciplines.</p>
        <p>When following a news piece on the exponential economic integrations of Artificial Intelligence, shifting
          our
          gaze
          to a visual artefact rife with sublime “neural aesthetics”, and then proceeding to examine an installation
          of
          smart
          home assistants communicating with one another, the underlying referent of AI shifts and shuffles. The
          complexity
          intensifies when realising that AI often refers to ASI (artificial superintelligence), or AGI (artificial
          general
          intelligence)<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. AI is
          also
          used
          to refer to the academic field of Artificial Intelligence, and the term has come to represent a general
          algorithmic
          panacea within marketing rhetoric, an exciting prospect of added value for “AI-powered” products, and any
          chimaeric
          interstice within the semantic field.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>The ontological classifications and diversity of meanings that AI encroaches on are an assemblage with soft
          edges
          —
          not defined by formlessness but rather a gaseous loosening of form, appearing directly right in front of you
          but
          at
          the same time, severely out of focus. When one tries to tread closer and examine these visual veneers, they
          fall
          apart at once, sublimate, disintegrate, reshuffle, in front of one’s eyes. Smokescreens, mirrors, illusions.
          The
          front-face doesn’t hold up. Peering into the gap reveals the complex constellations of power flows, aptly
          concealed
          behind the sublime veneer, behind the circular signifier, the proxy of sublime non-understanding, othering,
          dissimulation.</p>

        <p>The deployment of AI seems to have onset at scales unconceivable in the previous century. This is largely
          thanks
          to
          the recently possible wide availability of data, the lifeblood of artificial intelligence. We have reached a
          point
          in social history where the readily available amount of training data has become sufficient for large-scale
          implementation and training of machine learning – its volume has doubled in the last ten years.<a href="#fn37"

          internetworked
          reality,
          this trend often appears to sprawl in tandem with the economic integration of AI into global industry. We
          are
          ushering towards an “AI-powered” era, the advent of which is gaining significant social momentum, furthering
          the
          social climate of the AI-hype. Unfortunately, the outcomes, at the time of writing, rarely deliver to their
          promises.</p>
        <p>Our collective imagination seems to be stirred about the potentials of autonomous, creative AI —- of true,
          non-human intelligence. Artificial intelligence is capable of highly complex calculations, while still in
          its
          (literal) infancy in terms of abstract reasoning capabilities.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> Discussions on the epistemological potentials of the
          creativity of AI are
          hardly new. In his essay Words made Flesh, scholar Florian Cramer examines some different historical debates
          regarding the creative limits of artificial intelligence, tracing some to as early as the 17<sup>th</sup>
          century:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“In 1674, three years after his permutational sonnet, Quirinus Kuhlmann published his correspondence with
            Athanasius Kircher in a book epistolae duae. It documents an early debate about automatically generated
            art
            and
            its cognitive limitations. In his …. He [Kuhlmann] rejects the idea of a machine …. that generates poetry,
            arguing
            that such a machine could indeed be built, but it would not produce good artistic results. One could
            teach,
            Kuhlmann writes, every little boy verse composition through simple formal rules and tables of elements
            (“paucis
            tabellis”). The result however would be versiﬁcations, not poetry (“sed versûs, non poëma”).”<a href="#fn39"
              class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In the correspondence, the limit to artificial creativity is set by theological reservations. In our
          present
          episteme, the limit appears to be drawn from the bleeding edge of computing power.</p>

          Pictures
        </h2>
        <p>In itself, AI is neither a benign nor malign force. In common parlance, the term “AI” picks out a loosely
          entangled
          cluster of technological projects, undertaken since 1956 under this now-well-known denominator. In 1959, the
          term
          “machine learning” was coined. From its inception, AI has been largely funded by defence departments and
          developed
          with the goal of advancing United States in the cold-war-era race. The industry soon branched out to other
          nations.

        <h2 id="technological-sublime-algorithmic-sublime">Technological Sublime, Algorithmic Sublime</h2>
        <p>The presence of an awe-inspiring veneer is difficult to contest in the public image of AI. It is important
          to
          elaborate on the notion of technological sublime, which underpins the conceptual development of this thesis.
          The
          technological sublime has been defined by scholars as</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"… a feeling of "astonishment, awe, terror, and psychic distance"—feelings once reserved for natural
            wonders
            or
            intense spiritual experiences, but increasingly applied to technologies that are new and potentially
            transformatory, but also complex and poorly understood.”<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
              role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A precondition to achieving a sublime experience is that “one must be somewhat inexperienced with an
          object,
          landscape, or engagement…” The reduction in the sublime qualities of a referent is achieved by “experience
          and
          familiarity”.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> It is
          questionable how much familiarity aforementioned visual depictions allow for. “Familiarity with an object
          threatens
          to undermine its potential sublimity”.</p>
        <p>AI’s unfamiliarity, its exponential emergence and the sudden flood of media attention, all provide ample
          grounds
          for evoking sublime feelings in the beholder.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“The ways that algorithms ignite the contemporary cultural imagination …. makes them seem still in the
            realm
            of
            science fiction, harbingers of a revolutionary future of which we are forever on the cusp.”<a href="#fn45"
              class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>AI with human-like characteristics is quickly creeping into our lives – that might be the problem, that it
          is
          human-like, anthropomorphically conceived and designed. Anthropomorphism isn’t necessarily a bad thing – In
          commercial applications, robots that resemble humans, and at the same time avoid falling into the uncanny
          valley,
          boost greater public acceptance and empathy towards the machines.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref"

        <p>AI could be described as an amorphous entity. As a signifier, it morphs to fit the identity of the field in
          which
          it is deployed. AI the doctor cures cancer, AI the artist creates paintings, AI the economist predicts
          return
          rates.
          Representing AI with such human-like agency and subjectivity serves to maintain its position as a terminus
          of
          responsibility, gatekeeping its broader context ­– the power constellations producing it. It also projects
          into
          AI
          a
          certain striving to subjectivity, to humanity – AI holds up a mirror to our own biases and hopes. The way in
          which
          its disclosure has been designed is misleading at best, and hugely detrimental to our relating at worst.</p>
        <p>It is said within the AI industry that once a task has been achieved by a machine, it is no longer
          considered
          intelligent.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> At first,
          such
          tasks were menial. They are becoming more and more advanced, as AI finds applications in nearly all

        <p>Artificial Intelligence is a theoretical discipline which has been used increasingly to automate an
          increasing
          number of processes within an increasing number of enterprises and industries. It has no inherent visual

          except for the visual notation of theoretical formulas, visual outputs, tools used to develop it, interface
          of
          dataset labelling programs, command-line interfaces etc. Its meaning is therefore prone to
          misrepresentation,
          further intensified by a lack of clear consensus,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"

        <p>The visual artefacts appear as a diversion to cast our glances towards while the actual deployment and
          unfolding
          of
          AI into the social fabric continues in much sneakier, clandestine ways. We have been castrated of our
          ability
          to
          recognise AI when it actually happens.</p>
        <p>The mediated presence of AI is marked by a diffuse signifier, that points into many different directions
          and
          discloses little. Its underlying regime is organised around the upkeeping of power, the withholding of the
          possibility of dissent. It keeps in place the absence of possibilities of questioning AI, by wrapping its
          public
          presence in a sublime veil – an impenetrable, imperceptible barrier, rather than an invitation for further
          discussions.</p>
        <p>In her book Capital is dead, MacKenzie Wark traces the emergence of a new mode of social relations, a
          global
          operation of capital accumulation based on the control of the tools used for the interpretation of data.
          Walmart,
          for instance controls "“almost as many data centers as physical distribution centers, and they are about as
          large.”<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> Data is

            role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> The same data-centric rationality is increasingly extending to the
          governmental level, with AI being increasingly used to delineate and command the economic, political reality

          world. This data is extremely valuable, it is used to extract all sorts of predictive metrics about
          individual
          or
          group behaviour.</p>

        <p>The increasing consolidation of data as a resource for capital accumulation has severe implications for the
          average
          person, who does not own any access to these tools of data interpretation. The problem lies with the
          “extraction
          of
          what you might call <em>surplus information</em>, out of individual workers and consumers, in order to build
          predictive models which further subordinate all activity to the same information political economy.”<a

          <p>At small scales or with narrowly scoped "translations", this is actually fine. Accounting software is a

            algorithms to extract ‘intelligence’ from these open sources of data, mainly for the purpose of predicting
            consumer behaviours and selling ads. The knowledge economy morphed into a novel form of capitalism, called

          monetise the extracted data. AI is not out there to get us. The people deploying and operating it, are,

            Little does the businessman know that he is not actually tugging against an anthropomorphic AI – he is
            fighting
            against a constellation of technicist power structures.</figcaption>

        <p>It is reasonable to expect that this intensifying trend of automatization, towards ubiquitous permeation of
          AI,
          will continue as more and more aspects of our existence continue to be commodified as data points, as more
          data
          is
          being produced by an increasing number of “smart” devices, indices, metrics, flows. It is therefore not a
          question
          of <em>will</em> AI, but rather to react with urgency to <em>how</em> it is coming into being. We need to
          rework
          the
          core societal mechanisms that permit its social standing – the economic and legal apparatuses, the media
          circuitry,
          the gatekeeping of awareness, of understanding. The economic apparatus is not likely to budge anytime soon,
          since
          big data is seemingly the new big source of capital. “While power is capable of everything, what it cannot
          do
          is
          let
          go of power.”<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> More

        <p>Returning our sights to the publicly mediated figurations, we can quickly see that they are largely
          anonymous
          –
          they focus on AI, rather than the constellations it is operating from and suspended within. While we are
          transfixed
          on this monolithic visual representation, the real work is happening behind the scenes. In this role, it is
          effectively serving as a proxy, making us look one way in sublime awe, while further othering the
          technology.
          When
          examined with more detail, the engineered cultural authority of AI is nothing more than a Potemkin village.
          Unlike
          the original ploy, however, purpose of this exalted façade is not to oversignify status to the regime in
          power.
          It
          appears to be quite the opposite – it is the regime in power performing to the people.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the present mythologies surrounding anthropomorphic AI have stirred Western collective
          imagination
          for
          a
          long time.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> As detached
          from
          reality as the representations appear, they hold denotative legitimacy for most beholders. Paradoxically, it
          appears
          that the aesthetic fiction surrounding AI has become more real than reality itself and usurped the
          hypostatic
          “authentic truth”, further affirming the simulacra-like nature of AI’s cultural standing.</p>

        <p>AI performs as a sort of partition - in front, the technology is kept opaque. Beyond, constellations of
          power
          with
          their human rights abuses, labour abuses, have also successfully hidden. The sublime rhetoric (that the
          black
          box
          talk is also part of) might be likened to a smoke screen, which prevents nuanced understanding. The sublime
          aesthetic trends have become as incomprehensible as our understanding of AI. They are a reflection and
          accomplice
          in
          our societal confusion. The smoke screen in question does not perform in concealment of an authentic,
          genuine
          AI.
          It
          forms a structurally indispensable part of AI’s ontological presence.</p>

        <p>In his 2017 book, Against the Anthropocene, cultural critic TJ Demos presents an overview of the
          problematic
          term
          Anthropocene, and the sublime visuality used to mediate its corollary concept of climate destruction to the
          general
          public. The imagery used to mediate the phenomenon hardly answer to an investigative agenda. They most often
          bestow
          sublime awe, and a complete anonymisation, diffusion of culpability. Demos warns of the neoliberalist
          political
          ideologies embedded in the staging of visual material surrounding the Anthropocene, and the agenda to
          diffuse
          the
          sense of individual agency, responsibility, or inquiry into the massive global apparatus of resource
          extraction.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a> A similar

        <p>Besides hiding AI’s planetary, resource-based nature, current trends in disclosure perform as a withholder
          of
          technological literacy from citizens, diffusing and dissimulating responsibility for the enterprise’s
          operations.
          Educating citizens means giving them a vocabulary to grow bridges of relating towards these emerging
          technologies,
          of considering, of having a common sensical understanding and opinion, of possibly being critical towards
          the
          data-fuelled enterprises and the asymmetrical transactions they rely on. A shift towards transparent
          disclosure
          would expose an extremely telling compass for locating the networks of power and mapping out their impact in
          the
          world.</p>
        <p>The global AI enterprise itself is too vast to grasp or survey by an individual. This brings a diffusion of
          responsibility. Who to point at with a possible <em>j’accuse</em>? What proverbial door might a list of
          demands
          be
          posted to? Who is to be held accountable? The mediated visuality conceals the culprits fully.</p>
        <p>I would like to disband any implication of orchestrated intentionality within these visual trends. I
          believe
          they
          are symptoms of a disorganised sprawling and striving to power, which rather than being meticulously
          orchestrated
          and deployed, “proceeds in a mindless automatic fashion.”<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"

        <p>We are undergoing exponential proliferation of AI discourse, with many scholars exploring complications
          that
          the
          exponential accroaching and integration of the technology into the fabric of our daily reality has brought

        <p>The inequality in the development of AI is also underpinned by the factual reality that AI has become much
          more
          power-intensive in recent years. The capital needed to train these AI is in the hands of the a priori
          wealthy,
          elite, research institutions, etc. that further propagate the unequal distribution of AI research and
          representation.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a>
          Another
          huge
          social problem of AI is the lack of ethics education in the scientific and industry sectors that engineer
          these
          predictive models. This problem is intimately interwoven with disproportionately high funding of top AI
          researchers
          by corporate entities with their own agendas of capital accumulation,<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> overtaking public capacities in terms of mobility and
          budget.
        </p>
        <p>Governmental initiatives for the mass deployment of AI seek to automate policy, including the increase of
          the
          efficiency of surveillance systems and the automation of citizen control. The industry is a prolific subject
          for
          the
          examination of so many defining power structures, systemic inequalities, and societal biases of our time.
          The
          global
          project of AI has repeatedly been exposed as neoliberal, colonial, racist, and uncritically predictive.
          Sabelo
          Mhlambi comments succinctly:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“In the present age, artificial intelligence is increasingly being used as the moral arbitrator of
            society,
            and
            the institutions largely advancing its ethics are incredibly non-representative of diverse human and
            interrelated
            human experience. AI is dominated by white institutions, elite, wealthy, and often heralded as the prime
            answer
            to
            social problems. Through”intelligent" machines whose decisions and ways surpass human comprehension and
            explainability, and, through the datafication of humans, nature, can discern and predict human action and
            intent,
            therefore being justified to mediate human affairs, a white serving creation myth emerges. It is a myth
            that
            alleges the supremacy and impartiality of algorithms, an implied morality, while in actuality automating
            social
            biases that favor whiteness and marginalize non-white people.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The creation myth of AI is a carte blanche upon which the same “matrix of domination”<a href="#fn83"
            class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a> is escribed, upon which an
          Anglo-centric
          gaze reigns supreme. The anonymous aesthetics, and the discursive tendency for AI to be portrayed as a force
          majeure, further keep in place this inequality, lend space for the perpetuation of the same colonial
          dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>As it stands, AI remains a brilliant multi-purpose tool. It is also a salient mirror to our own biases and
          unclarities. The computer will always compute exactly what it has been instructed to. The instructions
          (structural
          changes) are what we have to work on.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"

        <p>It is impossible to give a definite form to AI. Every figuration of it is a creative gesture. Every act of
          depicting it marks a distancing from reality– without implied intentionality, a mediation, a dissimulation
          (by
          virtue of gap between reality and signifier) of its true nature. Every act of depiction is therefore an act
          of
          subliming/resubliming AI. In the act, a new fiction is inevitably created, the meaning is encoded, a new
          mythology
          given birth.</p>
        <p>Communicative design is “engaged at the same time in the private interests of clients and media. To secure
          its
          existence…. [it] must constantly strive to neutralize these inherent conflicts of interest by developing a
          mediating
          concept aimed at consensus.”<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>Innately embedded in social reality, each act of design advances an agenda and may be seen as an inherently
          political act. Each choice to select a designed artefact, to elect a specific predetermined image to mediate
          a
          concept to a viewership, further reinforces the arbitrary union between the intangible concept of AI, and
          the
          visual
          stand-in used to mediate it to the general public.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Today, visual design no longer solely exists for example on the canvas of a poster nor the printed
            matter
            bound
            into books. It exists intangibly, embodying products completely removed from physical space. It works to
            represent
            businesses with no offices, or technology with no hardware.”<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref"

        </blockquote>
        <p>There will be more and more intangible concepts generated as the digitisation of our global reality
          proceeds,
          each
          with a unique semantic gap that will have to be filled by a visual stand-in. It will become increasingly
          important
          to determine how these referents are created. It is difficult to observe a creation of organic visual
          culture,
          since
          these technologies are becoming increasingly abstract and artificial as our world becomes increasingly
          pervaded
          by
          technology.</p>

        <p>Ziarek’s aphetic forcework refers to the reconfiguring of social relations, a coming-into-being of poietic
          potential, manifesting a Heideggerian momentum of release, <em>Gelassenheit</em>. Ziarek and Demos both
          express
          a
          strong belief in collaborative, participatory practices in redirecting the social momentum, raising the
          potential
          of
          art and design “as a collaborative and interactive, rather than individual-oriented, medium”<a href="#fn89"

        <p>In our visual-driven culture, figurations play a central role in mediating any given concept. The solution
          lies
          in
          disrupting the identical replication of an exhausted referent, in diversifying the representation and thus
          refusing
          the status quo of AI to be reduced as a consolidated entity via its monolithic aesthetic. I concur with
          Ziarek
          in
          the importance of creating (visual) expression marked by an “…unwillingness to subsist on the terms
          prescribed

        <h2 id="the-cartographic-shift-and-importance-of-cognitive-mapping">The “Cartographic Shift” and Importance of
          Cognitive Mapping</h2>
        <p>Visual representations have attempted to capture the totality of the global internetworked AI enterprise,
          often
          referred to as the 'global AI supply-chain'.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a> The attempt to depict these visual flows and figurate them in a
          cartographic
          format, brings with itself inherent problems – It is impossible to escape a degree of essentialism.</p>
        <p>Toscano and Kinkle refer to Jameson’s appeal for the urgency of critical cognitive mapping, and posit that
          “cultural producers, for the most part, do not literally attempt to generate maps of the new interconnected
          global
          reality, or even to address it frontally.”<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a> According to them, the critical addressal of our global
          technocapitalist
          society is rarely undertaken by producers of (visual) culture. Rather, it is up to the critic to survey and
          respond
          to. It is here that the role of design can play an interesting role. In a unique position, the designer can
          function
          both as critic and cultural/visual producer. In his 1994 essay <em>Design and Reflexivity</em>, Dutch author
          Jan
          van
          Toorn urges (fellow) designers to cease perpetuating the same symbolic forms, instead "[m]oving from a
          reproductive
          order to a commentating one, operative criticism can make use of a long reflexive practice …”<a href="#fn95"
            class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a> By entering the machinery of
          cultural
          production and destabilising from within.</p>
        <p>This multidirectional potency gives the designer-critic a unique perspective/potential to agency from which
          to
          comment on cultural developments while at the same time, producing culture. The immense need for cognitive
          mapping
          in our advanced technocapitalist society has resulted in several cartographic endeavours. The cartographic
          endeavour
          of ‘mapping capitalism’<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a>
          is
          to
          a growing extent, coextensive with the cartographic endeavour of mapping Artificial Intelligence. It shares
          the
          same
          gestures, and runs along a coaxial objective. This project of cartography involves the mission of “complex
          seeing”,
          of an omniscient narrator that surveys the landscape and reveals its intricacies, inner mechanisms,
          workings,
          flows.
          In this regard, the cartographic narrator transcends “around” the power dynamic. They disclose and divulge
          the
          global constellation into discernible parts. And in the process desubliming it and shedding light onto the
          anatomical complexity of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
        <p>At the core of the sublime disclosure of such technologies lies the fact that these technologies are, in
          essence,
          theoretical models resulting in vast systems of physical infrastructure, data flows, involving a plethora of
          actors
          and nodes. By sole virtue of their complexity, they are impossible to disclose in concise aesthetic form,
          such
          as
          an
          image or headline. The intentionality of such artefacts in media emissions is further steered by corporate
          agendas
          and bridled further by the constellations of power that exert influence open it.</p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p>Perhaps the exalted aesthetic trends are simply a reflection of excitement for the possible innovations
          that
          artificial intelligence may bring into our internetworked society. This does not take away from the long
          record
          of
          violations of data rights, human labour, and intensifying stratification of capital, all become othered from
          the
          hyper-entity of AI being disclosed as a sublime force, rather than a traceable topology of real-time
          processes
          and
          infrastructure, backed by accountable agents.</p>
        <p>The exponentially sprawling enterprise of AI is becoming increasingly interwoven into the global circuit of
          commerce, policy-making apparatuses, and it is equally pervading the social fabric of our public and private
          life.
          It is not however, done in the conspicuous, caricatural gesture that it is most usually portrayed as doing
          in
          public
          emissions. The presence of AI has become interwoven in society in a much more diffuse manner. Endeavours to
          map
          the
          outlines of this global Colossus have been on the rise in the recent years.</p>

          social
          moment is sensitised for:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Ultimately, the Nooscope manifests for a novel Machinery Question in the age of AI. The Machinery
            Question
            was
            a
            debate that sparked in England during the industrial revolution, when the response to the employment of
            machines
            and workers’ subsequent technological unemployment was a social campaign for more education about
            machines,
            that
            took the form of the Mechanics’ Institute Movement.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Joler and Pasquinelli’s mapping and its accompanying essay accomplish a lucid task of discussing the
          extremely
          nonvisual aspect on AI, by inventing visual language used to mediate it, and basing their argumentation on
          the
          conceptual substratum that it creates.</p>
        <p>Cartographic disclosure may be a potent strategy of insurrection of the globalising technicist agenda – it
          is
          an
          undertaking towards the becoming-known of the unknowable, the grasping of the ungraspable, the absolute
          disclosure
          of the diffuse, exponentially growing enterprise of Artificial Intelligence. Once you can trace the contours
          of
          the
          gargantuan enterprise, you can begin to sense and trace who the actors involved are, how they interoperate,
          and
          even
          more importantly, whereby the blame might lay, who might be deriving capital from its workings. Such global
          mapping
          attempts are entrapped into their own dialectic:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Overview, especially when it comes to capital, is a fantasy – if a very effective, and often
            destructive,
            one.
            Because we can’t extricate ourselves from our positions in a totality that is such through its unevenness
            and
            antagonism, there is in the end something reactionary about the notion of a metalanguage that could
            capture,
            that
            could represent, capitalism as such.”<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"
              role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There is no such thing as a conclusive, exhaustive, disclosure of AI. The potency of mapping lies in its
          gesture
          of
          showing the iceberg for what it is – a cryptogram of knowledge, power, resources, corporate actors. Such
          critical
          initiatives frontally address the misleading front face of “AI-Powered” tech; they rupture and predispose
          existing
          social relations in subtle, inventive ways. We need a new rhetoric and encourage against sensationalist
          titles
          and
          parlance, in which AI is donned an autonomous, human-like personality and character, which further discloses
          it
          as
          sublime entity with human-like cognitive capacities, while setting expectations for its anticipated
          performance
          disproportionately high.</p>
        <p>From charming nonentity, to performative scientific tool, to an integrated invisible force, the ontological
          presence of AI has undergone a cascade of paradigm shifts. AI-powered, to AI-dominated, we are in the midst
          of
          a
          rapid destabilisation of social relations and a renewed formation of forces. It is <em>also</em> the role of
          imagery
          and visual mediation here, and cultural production and large to establish these new relationalities of
          poietic
          potential. It seems rather unlikely that cartographic endeavours will take centre stage in the public
          theatre
          any
          time soon. It takes little argumentation to agree that a holographic rendition of a robot is more
          universally
          mediatable than a several-thousand-word academic diagram.</p>
        <p>Our episteme is sensitised for a redefinition of the visual language used to disclose emergent technologies
          and
          asks for a more vigilant approach, combined with a generally better understanding of the highly abstracted
          technologies we use on a daily basis.</p>

          <p>The AI incidents database is described by its authors as “intended for users that need to discover
            whether
            their
            intelligent system or problem area has previously produced incidents in the real world.” The user can
            query
            the
            database for specific types of incident, for example only those involving “facial recognition”. At the
            time
            of
            writing, the database consists of 1175 press reports of AI-related incidents. Showing chinks in AI’s
            armour
            is
            a
            potent strategy for dispelling the sublime frontage.</p>

        <p>The conceptual slot carved out by the sudden presence new technologies has largely been filled in by blasé
          figurations. A shift towards the development of a poetics of AI is needed, to invent new words, signs, and
          meanings
          to relate to these new technologies.</p>

        <p>The answer may lie in devising better words for delineating the concept. Kahn urges us to rethink the
          aesthetic
          language and cultural forms used to mediate these new technologies. The author quotes poet Jackie Wang, who
          wrote
          on
          their experience of encountering figurations of aliens: “…aliens could look like anything and yet we
          represent
          them
          as creatures close to humans. The aliens at this museum had two legs, two eyes, mouth — their form was
          essentially
          human. I wondered, is this the best we can come up with?”<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> AI is an alien too, something we have never seen before, and is
          becoming
          increasingly potent … There is a lot of poignancy in the comparison – I fully agree that we are in dire need
          of
          “an
          imaginative paradigm shift”.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"

        <p>As it stands, AI is represented as simulacrum of what non-human subjectivity may look like, a poor image, a
          replica. All other alternative possibilities, including a plethora of ones in which AI might not conform to
          anthropocentrism, are dauntingly scary, and very rarely depicted. It seems like we are trying to ascribe an
          overall
          veneer of familiarity, and control, into the emergence of AI, by disclosing it as ≤ human, possibly equal,
          and
          vehemently never more. Kahn observes how “For most people, thinking of a world in which we are not the
          central
          intelligence is not only incredibly difficult but also aesthetically repulsive. Popular images of AGI
          [artificial
          general intelligence], let alone true ASI [artificial superintelligence], are soaked in doomsday
          rhetoric._”_<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a></p>

          –
          of words becoming flesh. Our collective imagination is stirred by the promises of these technologies, their
          limitations, and potential shifts they bring about. The fascination is a sort of uroboros, self-defeating,
          self-perpetuating:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Computation and its imaginary are rich with contradictions and loaded with metaphysical and ontological
            speculation. Underneath those contradictions and speculations lies an obsession with code that executes,
            the
            phantasm that words become flesh. It remains a phantasm, because again and again, the execution fails to
            match
            the
            boundless speculative expectations invested into it.”<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"

        <p>Developing diverse visual expressions to mediate the concept of AI is a viable step forward, but it is not
          enough.
          A critical position is of fundamental importance for the image-producer – being aware of which agendas are
          being
          perpetuated with every figuration. Van Toorn mobilises fellow designers “to apply our imaginative power once
          again
          to how we deal with communicative reality.”<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
        <p>A <em>détournement</em> is not enough. The visual artefacts are symptoms, rather than instruments with/of
          their
          own
          pointed agency. We need a coherent demolishing, and restructuring, towards a new, different, more informed,
          more
          inclusive reality, in which AI is a more universally understood topic in fundamental discussions, rather
          than
          an
          impenetrable force, impossible to interact, interface, or negotiate with.</p>
        <p>Poietic figurations showing the possibilities of AI are extremely valuable. Decontextualised, and built
          upon
          a
          fundamental societal non-understanding, and even fear of these technologies, however, they may further
          perpetuate
          the sublime otherness of emerging technologies. So, I believe that resubliming these technologies should
          come
          second
          to education.</p>

        <p>It is impossible to do differently than <em>consent by default</em> to these recent technological
          developments,
          and
          the increasing footprint they are claiming in one’s personal territory, existence, subjectivity – they’re
          being
          implemented on a playing field one had no prior awareness or knowledge of, and equally little agency to
          delineate.
          We should advocate for greater awareness, knowledge, a fundamental epistemological reconfiguration of the
          policies
          and strategies for mediating the concept of AI to the general public. We need positive complications with
          potential
          to inspire closer examination, dissent, discussion, a plurality of opinions.</p>

        <p>Listening to an old podcast on the nascent introduction of the Internet, the confusion of people was
          equally
          grounded. The host confusedly asked: “What are you supposed to do with it, call it?”.<a href="#fn108"
            class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a> It was impossible to foresee the
          exponential growth that would happen in the years following. Right now, we’re seemingly in the middle of a
          similar
          process of exponential growth with AI, only that it has already come much further, and the average informed
          citizen
          has comparatively less knowledge about it, less possibility of participation, bereft of vocabulary to
          address
          it
          or
          frameworks of relating to it. We are only beginning to talk about it, and it is already well implemented.
          Not
          in
          a
          democratic way, but by the hegemonic constellations of power. And we know so disproportionately little about
          it
          compared to how much it knows about us, how much it is integrated into our daily lives. It is become some
          sort
          of
          permeating force, which has pervaded the very reality of our common existence. In a similar way that the
          internet
          did in such a short period of time. Being internet illiterate in 2020 is a huge disadvantage. Being
          AI-illiterate,
          I
          imagine, might prove even more disadvantageous in the imminent future.</p>
        <p>In addition to the role that the shifting of aesthetic production towards socially consequential, active,

          expression can play in reconfiguring the complications of technopower, education is the foremost driver in
          changing
          the (aesthetic) discourse surrounding AI. In order to have a say in AI discussions and decisions regarding
          its
          increasing social prominence and integration into the fabric of our global society, we will need to
          <em>disalienate</em> it and find ways of understanding it sufficiently to pinpoint its shortcomings and hold
          the
          right people accountable.

        <p>AI becoming kin, or a future of “singularity” are one of an infinite number of possibilities. A big problem
          with
          imagery used to mediate the concept of artificial intelligence is the fact that it cannot seem to let go of
          putting
          the human first. A rethinking of this would surely help as a viable strategy forward. AI is already so
          othered,
          why
          do we not proceed to other it in more inventive, less solipsistic ways?</p>
        <p>In regard to the future potentials of non-human intelligence, keeping it within our own bounds – on our own
          territory, in the familiar – appears a repressive, colonial gesture. Envisioning possibilities of a greater
          other
          instils fear. Then we no longer hold dominion. If we begin to discuss true superintelligence that operates
          in
          its
          own, non-anthropocentric paradigm, our current visions of AI quickly reveal themselves as very naïve.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Rather than integration, it is important we first address the project of <em>disalienation</em> of AI as a
          growing
          urgency in our going forth — coming from the default and expected state of alienation from the actuality of
          the
          technology and its workings. To cede with its disclosure yielding to the paradigm of sublime simulacrum, but
          rather,
          to manifest its social potential in a relationality that is operational – one that is present, plausible,
          that
          bestows affordance for interaction, exchange, and intersubjectivity. One that is accessible. Counteracting
          these
          visual flows is on many occasions symmetrical with counteracting digital capitalism.</p>
        <p>Focusing on the provable, the material, might then be the better strategy towards dispelling the
          technological
          sublime and promoting fruitful societal discourse and participation in the huge benefits that emerging
          cybertechnologies are bringing into our common society.</p>
        <p>A shift of optics towards an emphasis on the human-powered, physical, fabric of algorithmic infrastructures
          and
          networks may serve as an important. <a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a> This will require a drastic change of course in the paradigm of
          aesthetic
          disclosure surrounding emergent technologies. Fundamentally, to actively guide new discourse towards the
          destabilisation of the immaculate, exalted aura that such emergent technologies adopt nearly as quickly as
          they
          are
          introduced.</p>
        <p>Desubliming comes in two prescriptions – the fundamental need to disclose an informed reality of AI to the
          public,
          rather than perpetuating the mythology. And a second, poietic resubliming – using figuration differently.

        <p>The act of seeing AI is not by zooming out to its totality – it is an impossible entity to map (Imagine
          disclosing
          the internet as a map at this point in time). It does help, however, to collectively know how it works on a
          baseline
          level, and what’s reasonable to demand, what’s unreasonable to expect. For that, we need a relating to it
          that’s
          based on accessibility and understanding. That requires looking underneath the sublime front, and
          desubliming
          it,
          to
          make room for information, for an elemental knowledge of the core workings. Passing the relay stick forth,
          the
          time
          comes for invoking the forgotten social contract of image-producers in imaginative figuration, of draping
          the
          signifier in different sublime dress. It is important to keep on weaving new mythologies and stories into
          existence.
          We have to liquefy the monolithic image, and not proceed to ossify another in its stead. Let’s move towards
          the
          welcoming of pluriformity… The myriad shifting faces of AI.</p>
